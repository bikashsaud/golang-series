### LOOPS
> In Go, there are three types of loops: for, while, and do-while.

> 1. FOR Loop:
> for loop: The for loop is used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times
```
for initialization; condition; increment {
    // code to execute
}
```


> 2. WHILE LOOP: There is no dedicated for loop

> we can make by using for loop as below:

```
initialization 

for condition {
    // code to execute
    increament
}
```



3. DO-WHILE LOOP:

> n Go, there is no dedicated do-while loop keyword like in some other programming languages. However, you can achieve the same functionality using a for loop with a post-condition.

```
initialization

for{
    increament

    condition{
        break
    }
}
```
