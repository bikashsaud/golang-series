### SWITCH CASE

> Used to evaluate an experission and perform different actions based on the value of experisson
> use switch statements with strings, booleans, and other data types. The syntax is the same, but the cases are matched based on the value of the expression.

```
switch expression {
case value1:
    // action to perform if expression equals value1
case value2:
    // action to perform if expression equals value2
...
default:
    // action to perform if expression does not match any of the above cases
}
```
