### Struct
> A struct (short for structure) is used to create a collection of members of different data types, into a single variable.

> While arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type into a single variable, structs are used to store multiple values of different data types into a single variable
 
``` golang
type struct_name struct{
    member1 datatype,
    member2 datatype,
    member3 datatype,
    member4 datatype,

}
```
