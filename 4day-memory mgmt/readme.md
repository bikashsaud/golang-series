> memory management by 2 ways:

1. new()
- allocate memory but not initialised
- you will get the memory address
- zeroed storage--> here you cann ot put any data in memory initialised

2. Make()
- allocate memory and initialised
- get memory by address
- non zero storage --> you can put some data to memory in initialised
